# JENGA
**🖥️💫 Elevating solutions for a better tomorrow. Also, knocking the competition down like jenga blocks.**

## What is this org for? 🤔

* ✅ **We are here to help solve the common problem many people at UIC face whenever it comes to choosing what food they can eat and where around them can serve their food**
* 🔄 **We are doing this by using Nutrionix's API V2 in order to give the user information on not only the food they eat, but also how their excersize can help imform them better about their caloric needs**
* 🙌 **Made by with love by a team of developers at UIC, inspired to code for the better of of our community, with their health and dietary restrictions in mind 💖**
* 🚀 **Continued open source contributions by team members and others as time has gone on, even after the hackathon!**
